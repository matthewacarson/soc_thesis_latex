  abstract = {When do labor movements come to support universal welfare policies? This article examines this question through a comparative account of the British and American labor movements at the turn of the twentieth century. Drawing on newspaper and meeting records from the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE), the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants (ASRS), the Cigarmakers International Union (CMIU), and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen (BLF) from the mid-nineteenth century to World War I, it considers why, given a common tradition of exclusive benefits, the two movements diverged on the question of universal state health and pension schemes at the turn of the century—with the British labor movement abandoning its voluntarist orientation and the AFL preserving it.Complementing existing sociological accounts that emphasize state and party structure, sectoral composition, pace and quality of industrial change, and the demographic makeup of labor movements, this article builds on approaches from the sociology of organizations in centering the importance of organizational arenas in shaping trade union strategies and aims. In particular, it investigates the role of friendly and fraternal societies in structuring trade union interests over this period. The article demonstrates how changes within the friendly and fraternal society movement shaped the contextual significance and strategic value of benefit provision in each trade union over time. In doing so, it opens the way for a deeper reflection on the importance of organizational reasoning in shaping trade union organizing and the trajectory of welfare institutions.},

  abstract = {Help Fight for Oakland AND Save Union Jobs!  The Oakland A’s are a long-time provider of thousands of good union jobs that are critical to Oaklanders and their families. The A’s are planning to move from their current home at the Oakland Coliseum to a new, privately financed ballpark located at the Howard Terminal site near Jack London Square.  If the A’s and the Oakland City Council can’t find an agreement on the new proposed ballpark at Howard Terminal, thousands of jobs and the billions of dollars of economic activity will leave our community.  Alameda Labor supports the A’s proposed Howard Terminal ballpark! The project proposed will protect existing Union jobs and bring thousands of NEW Union jobs for Oakland workers, both during construction and for the long-term. It will also provide a significant boost to Oakland’s economy and create substantial economic activity in the Howard Terminal area.  Benefits of the A’s project include:  JOBS: The new ballpark will protect more than 2,000 Union jobs that will disappear if the team leaves Oakland and will create more than 4,000 new jobs at the new ballpark and surrounding development. Construction will also create an estimated 2,700 new Union jobs.     ECONOMIC ACTIVITY: Construction on the ballpark will provide a significant boost to our economy at a time when it’s more needed than ever. Construction is estimated to generate \$8.7 billion in economic activity, and the ballpark is estimated to generate an additional \$2.5 billion annually once opened.     HOUSING: The proposed project includes 3,000 new units of housing, which will include affordable housing units.     PARKS: The project also includes 18+ acres of new, publicly accessible parks on the Oakland waterfront.     ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS: The Howard Terminal project will protect Oakland from sea level rise and will be built to an environmental gold standard. Cleanup of toxic contaminants in soil and groundwater is also included in the A’s proposal.     COMMUNITY BENEFITS: this agreement will include hundreds of millions of dollars in critically needed benefits for the Oakland community.  For Oakland's working families, we are urging the Oakland City Council to come to an agreement with the A's that keeps those Union jobs HERE - in OUR community. You can help protect your fellow Oakland workers and help us save thousands of vital jobs for Oakland residents.  We need your help! Please use this form to ask the Oakland City Council to find an agreement with the A’s that keeps our JOBS here. Please share this with your friends, family and colleagues.},

The percentage of construction workers employed by union contractors has declined even further because the fraction of union members working in the open shop sector rose from 29 to 46 percent between 1973 and 1981. The growth of the union-nonunion wage gap between 1967 and 1973 contributed to the initial decline in the percentage unionized, but that gap did not widen after 1973 and actually has narrowed substantially since 1978. Probably more influential has been the erosion of the productivity advantage of union contractors, which dropped substantially between 1972 and 1977 and vanished by 1982.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the role of the most-similar systems design and most-different systems design in comparative public policy analysis. The methods are based on John Stuart Mill’s ‘eliminative methods of induction’ and regularly mentioned in educational books in social research methodology in general and in comparative politics in particular. However, their role has been less prominent in the literature on public policy. The methods are particularly useful in cross-country studies where the number of research units is limited, but where the researcher operates with a variable-oriented approach. The present contribution outlines how the most-similar systems design and the most-different systems design should be applied in deductive and inductive research efforts. It also challenges claims that the methods are unable to cope with interaction effects and multiple causation. The chapter also discusses to what extent the two methods are still relevant, given the recent advances made in multi-level modelling and in qualitative comparative analysis (OCA). Here, the argument is raised that the most-similar systems design and the most-different systems design are useful for accounting for complex social processes, and also have the advantage of making it possible to eliminate a large number of potentially relevant explanatory variables from further analysis. As a consequence thereof, regression models using multi-level techniques should often be constructed according to the logical foundations of a most-different systems approach in situations where the number of cases is low at the system level.},

For craft unions, the apprenticeship system is primarily but not exclusively a method of exercising control over wages by regulating the supply of labor for the craft. The industrial union seeks primarily to fix the price of labor and approaches training as a problem affecting that price, not as a mechanism for the control of the labor supply. Problems of structural unemployment, poverty, civil rights, and economic growth, combined with the availability of public funds for training, have contributed to the expansion of union interests in training.},

For each studied case, the processes leading “from A to B” are reconstructed and analyzed in terms of ideal-type social mechanisms and then compared by making use of the identified mechanisms and ideal-type periodization. Central elements of CPT are path dependence, critical junctures and focal points, social mechanisms, context, periodization, and counterfactual analysis. The CPT approach is described, discussed, and compared with more formal and deterministic forms of process tracing, which are found to be less fruitful for systematic comparison.},

He joined the International Brotherhood of Pulp, Sulphite and Paper Mill Workers, and soon became a shop steward, then in 1971, he was elected as president of his local union.  That same year, the union merged into the new United Paperworkers' International Union, with Young continuing in his post.In 1973, Young was asked by the international union to assist with workers' campaigns in Houston and across east Texas.  He was successful in the role, and from 1975 worked full-time for the union as an international representative.  In 1988, he became the union's vice president for Region VI.In 1996, Young defeated Gerald Johnston, to win election as president of the union.  From 1997, he also served as a vice-president of the AFL-CIO.  As leader of the union, he negotiated a merger which formed the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union; he became the founding president of the new union, in 1999.  He continued to focus on strengthening the union's negotiating position, which he concluded would be best served by a merger into the United Steelworkers of America, which was completed in 2005.  He then retired, dying in 2019.},

  date = {2023},
  institution = {University of California, Berkeley},
  abstract = {From 2015-2020, massive booms in solar power and high-speed rail reconstructed landscapes across California's San Joaquin Valley. Globally rare alliances of construction unions with environmental justice and immigrant movements won breakthroughs in regional politics. How did construction workers reshape their power in response to the booms–and what formed their politics in this extraordinary direction? This dissertation argues that construction worker power hinged on unions' capacity to reproduce the workforce for urgent landscape transformations, while labor alliances were driven by shared political exclusion and common household struggles over social reproduction of the region's working class, Mexican-American majority. Drawing on five years of ethnographic and archival research, I compare the Fresno-Madera region, where these construction labor-immigrant-environmental justice alliances prevailed at crucial moments, to the Bakersfield region just to the south, where limited household ties, unstable overall employment, and conflicts over oil fractured potential coalitions. In conversation with environmental justice, Marxist feminist, and Marxist geography approaches–including Gramscian interpretations of Clyde Woods, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, and Matthew Huber–I develop a theory of environmental leverage, explaining how landscape transformation and the labor involved can challenge or entrench hegemony. The breakthroughs made by San Joaquin alliances in winning municipal office, jobsite power, and infrastructure redistribution help show how working and oppressed people can build pressing climate transitions by their own blueprints.},

We explore the trialectic relationship between capital, labour and nature in Canada’s public transit unions, primarily through the lens of labour geography. In a review of union documents and Canadian newspapers we find the state uses the environment as a wedge issue in its ‘war or position’ with unions, representing workers’ strike actions as harmful to the environment and the community. The state’s positioning of ATU members as crucial to both the functioning of communities and environmental sustainability lends itself to counter-hegemonic campaign strategies. We examine a recent campaign by Toronto’s ATU Local 113 entitled “Protecting What Matters” as a local union’s community and environmental strategies during a period of austerity. The paper concludes with lessons learned from a labour geography perspective and calls for a more community based approach to resistance.},

  abstract = {Dorothy Sue Cobble's “Up for Debate” retrospective on the early American Federation of Labor heralds a new era of scholarship connecting labor history to larger judgments about American institutionalism — be it business, politics, the law, or ideology. Cobble reclaims both the complexity of AFL structure and its oppositional stance to market fundamentalism from what she claims (à la E. P. Thompson) from the condescension of history: ultimately, she wants to reconsider the federation as “part of a progressive political tradition on which future generations of reformers can build.” The range of responses from four distinguished commentators suggest just how “radical” (to use a term contested throughout the exchange) Cobble's revisionist turn is. Melvyn Dubofsky, for example, who had once accepted the conventional “business unionism” dismissal of the AFL, now ventures halfway in Cobble's direction: the early AFL, he allows, may well have been more pluralist and politically contentious than previously recognized; however, there was a “darker” side of intolerance and missed opportunities that grew worse through the 1920s. Andrew Wender Cohen not only reaffirms Cobble's central claims regarding the de facto mixed-skill nature of the AFL, but goes further to emphasize its city-based struggles for workers' control. Altogether, the federation, he suggests, was at once a defining historical force in the period and of “vital” benefit to working people. Donna Haverty-Stacke prefers to interrogate further the very framing of the AFL across time. Just how and why labels like “pure and simple” and “conservative trade unionism” were created and “how they functioned” offer an agenda, she suggests, for further research. Within this forum, Julie Greene is the least inclined to accept Cobble's main premises. Although she welcomes renewed attention to the AFL's more innovative aspects, she insists that the federation be judged in relation to actually existing contemporary alternatives. In such light — particularly with attention to an incessant AFL attack on the Labor Left and support for US imperialism — the claim for AFL “radicalism,” in her view, appears far-fetched. Cobble responds with a gracious but full-throated defense of her core arguments.},

  abstract = {The 2008 economic crisis and its aftermath were viewed by many as the ‘Lazarus moment’ for the US left. After all, here was a crisis brought about by the classic contradictions of capitalism playing out on a political landscape shaped by vast and growing disparities of wealth and power. In familiar left foundational mythologies, this was a moment that would give rise to revolution or, at the very least, a ‘new New Deal’. And there was no shortage of commentary proclaiming no less than neoliberalism’s death agonies. Yet the left has been spectacularly unsuccessful in crafting a coherent response to this crisis, much less influence the terms of debate about its causes and solutions. The exaggerated proclamations of the beginning of the end of neoliberalism, unjustifiably inflated expectations of the Obama presidency, and the irrational exuberance stimulated by Occupy all point to the same reality: there is no left worth talking about in the United States and there has not been one for quite a while.  Not only is there no organized left capable of contending for hegemony; in more mundane terms, the left is no longer even capable of affecting the wage structure in the auto industry or intervening in urban development decisions in Brooklyn. Whole swaths of the population, no doubt the vast majority, never come in contact with left institutions or ideas. Historically, a left of the sort we describe has been anchored to a vibrant labour movement, which has provided the institutional resources, the living and breathing constituency, the core agenda and feet on the ground for any significant counterhegemonic intervention into the political economy. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how a left capable of challenging corporate power and capitalist hegemony could be built, much less survive, without being linked to a dynamic labour movement. George Soros’s Open Society Institute or other liberal foundations will not fund challenges to capitalist class power. Nor can a left capable of mounting such challenges be galvanized through appeals to an evanescent ‘public’ or the ‘people’. For one thing, such appeals have to be projected through the corporate news and public information industry, which will never give serious left critiques or agendas fair hearing. Moreover, formation of a serious anticapitalist force in American politics will not be sparked by dramatic actions or events, not least because the constituency for that sort of left does not yet exist; it must be created. That is a lesson that must be taken from the reality of our defeat: on the one hand, the relentlessness of the post-crash capitalist offensive understandably feeds a sense of urgency in fighting back; on the other hand, their relentlessness is possible only because we do not have the capacity to challenge them.},

It extends classical qualitative analysis through a systematic method of comparing cases, and complements quantitative data analyses through a novel approach involving a mathematical algorithm that employs Boolean algebra. When it is difficult to apply statistics due to a very small number of cases, comparative analysis can still uncover important causal patterns. Unlike regression-based techniques that rely on symmetric correlations, qualitative comparative analysis presents an alternative way to analyse social science data using set theory, by comparing all possible pairs of cases to determine which causal conditions are redundant (not associated with the outcome of interest) and which configurations of surviving causal conditions are minimally sufficient for the outcome. This methodology allows researchers to identify causal relevance from even a small number of cases, combining Boolean algebra with philosophical concepts such as sufficiency and necessity, as well as counterfactual analysis. Specific to Boolean algebra and Qualitative Comparative Analysis is a feature called equifinality, identifying multiple causal paths that lead to the same outcome.},

These solutions should be less complex than the original observed configurations, as parsimonious as possible, without sacrificing the sufficiency requirement. Sufficiency and parsimony are two requirements that act in opposition, and an optimal solution is one that accommodates both. There are different search strategies that lead to different types of solutions, with an ongoing debate about which solution type is closest to the true, underlying causal structure. This article presents the different logics behind each simplification system in order to explain how and why they lead to different results and introduces the concept of “robust sufficiency” to clear the debate. It analyses the correctness ratios for the different solution type and provides an improved set of procedures to measure correctness that captures the best features from each system. Out of the competition between the conservative and the parsimonious search strategies, the intermediate solution emerges as the best hybrid that is suitable for causal analysis, outperforming the parsimonious solution in recovering a known (even parsimonious) causal structure.},

This largely non-white, working-class city of a hundred thousand had experienced the by-products of decades' worth of poverty, substandard housing, and poorly funded public education. It had one of the highest homicide rates, per capita, in the country and a jobless rate often twice the national average. But in 2012, when veteran labour reporter Steve Early moved from New England to Richmond, he witnessed a surprising transformation. In Refinery Town, Early chronicles the ten years of successful community organizing in Richmond that raised the minimum wage, defeated a casino development project, created a municipal ID to aid undocumented workers, reduced crime through "community policing," challenged home foreclosures, and took on a big oil giant. This compelling story of a city remade provides a model for citizens engaged in local politics and community building anywhere.},

  abstract = {The misclassification of employees as independent contractors has been the focus of recent attention as a result of the implementation of that employment model by ride-share and other gig employers. But the practice long predates the emergence of the gig economy, particularly in the construction industry. This article traces the history of misclassification in construction and the subsequent emergence of a cash-based underground system of compensation, which have lowered standards and been among the major causes of the decline of union density in the industry. In addition, the author examines the regulatory environment at the federal level, which has largely enabled misclassification as well as attempts by state agencies to adopt more aggressive enforcement policies.},

Union members have enjoyed better than average wages and benefits, excellent training opportunities, and decent jobsite conditions. But in the last thirty years the industry has undergone a dramatic transformation. This article describes the decline in union density, the drop in construction wages, the growth of anti-union forces, the changes in labor force demographics, the shift toward construction management, and the emergence of an underground economy. It also analyzes how building trades unions have responded to these changes, identifies structural impediments to union renewal, and proposes strategies for building trades unions to reassert their presence and power.},

  abstract = {"The construction trades once provided unionized craftsmen a route to the middle class and a sense of pride and dignity often denied other blue-collar workers. Today, union members still earn wages and benefits that compare favorably to those of college graduates. But as union strength has declined over the last fifty years, a growing non-union sector offers lower compensation and more hazardous conditions, undermining the earlier tradition of upward mobility. Revitalization of the industry depends on unions shedding past racial and gender discriminatory practices, embracing organizing, diversity, and the new immigrant workforce, and preparing for technological changes. Mark Erlich blends long-view history with his personal experience inside the building trades to explain one of our economy's least understood sectors. Erlich's multifaceted account includes the dynamics of the industry, the backdrop of union policies, and powerful stories of everyday life inside the trades. He offers a much-needed overview of construction's past and present while exploring roads to the future"-- Provided by publisher.},

  abstract = {While beginning research on the labor reformers of the Progressive Era, I was struck by the paucity of biographical information about Selig Perlman, one of the seminal members of the “Wisconsin School” of labor historians. In seeking to supplement the existing record, I recorded an interview on January 29, 1989, with Selig Perlman's son, Mark Perlman, University Professor of Economics at the University of Pittsburgh. As edited below, Mark Perlman's testimony, I believe, offers a most valuable perspective on the life of his father, the surrounding circle of teachers and students at the University of Wisconsin, and the generational as well as intellectual transitions within the field of labor scholarship through the early 1930s. Mark Perlman's perspective is conditioned both by personal experience and by his own professional training, initially in the same fields of labor economics and labor history pioneered by his father and his father's teacher, John R. Commons. At the personal level, the son spent many hours alone with his father (Mark's mother, Eva Shaber, died in 1930 when Mark was six, whence his father re-married the mother's younger sister, Fannie); from age 13 he calculates that he listened to his father talk about “the evolution of his ideas … his problems of getting along with people,” etc. for “the better part of four or five hours a week.” This closeness, Mark allows, was less a “comradeship” than “a European father with a very devoted, admiring son.” From the time the son was in junior high school, in fact, the father had convinced him to follow in his own scholarly footsteps. Mark took his BA and MA in economics at the University of Wisconsin and even briefly served as his father's graduate assistant. In 1950 he received his PhD under Carter Goodrich at Columbia University. His dissertation was published in 1954 as Judges in Industry: A Study in Labour Arbitration in Australia. During appointments at the University of Hawaii, Cornell, and Johns Hopkins, Mark Perlman pursued a labor-centered research agenda represented by Labor Union Theories in America: Background and Development (1958), The Machinists: A New Study in American Trade Unionism (1961), and Democracy in the IAM (1962). Subsequently, in a distinguished career at the University of Pittsburgh, Mark Perlman's research emphasis shifted to health and population economics, even as he maintained a continuing interest in the history of economics. He created in 1968 the American Economic Association's pace-setting Journal of Economic Literature. Incidentally, it may interest readers that in addition to labor scholars and economists, the Perlman line produced Judith Martin, Selig's niece and Mark's cousin, author of the famous, and ongoing, “Miss Manners” etiquette column.},

Veteran journalist Stephen Franklin shows how labor disputes at Bridgestone/Firestone, Caterpillar, and A.E. Staley left lasting scars on this town and its citizens--and marked a turning point in American labor history. When workers went on strike to retain such basic rights as job security and the 8-hour day, the corporations hit back with unprecedented hard-line tactics. Through the moving stories of individual workers and union activists, Franklin illuminates the hardships and disillusionment left in the wake of the strikes, and the powerful forces that caught an unprepared labor leadership off guard. He vividly portrays how the balance of labor-management power was shifted by corporate globalization, cutthroat labor practices, the outdated responses of national unions and government regulators, and an apathetic public. Reflecting on the hard-won lessons of Decatur, the book describes how the quality of work and life are now threatened--not just for blue-collar workers, but for all Americans--and what it will take to safeguard them.},

  abstract = {Progressive activists are increasingly stressing the importance of organizing and “building power” for oppressed groups, like welfare recipients, low‐wage immigrant workers, and low‐income youth, who had previously been the subject of advocacy efforts by professional activists such as lawyers and social workers. Many of these organizing efforts are being compromised by a failure to confront the way social struggles are shaped by the social conditions in which they are situated. Organizing campaigns are frequently initiated without regard to whether a given group of people, if organized, would have the power to force changes from the institutions they are confronting. The failure to face this critical power dynamic leads activists to overemphasize the importance of both the consciousness‐raising aspect of the work and the power dynamics between professional staff and the people being organized. The result is that in many cases they are transforming the appearance               but not the substance               of what are, in effect, traditional advocacy campaigns.},

Considered is how the philosophy of pragmatism and an emphasis on empiricism manifested in economics practice at Wisconsin. To understand why the empirical method—encompassing field studies, data collection and organization, and case studies—was so important to the Wisconsin institutionalists requires recognizing that their work was empirical in a very specific way. The Wisconsin economists chose their studies with definite reform goals in mind—reforms that could be achieved either through regulatory changes or by a change of law. They engaged in constructive research—research specifically designed to identify problems and potential solutions. That the Wisconsin institutionalists generated substantial amounts of materials that repeatedly demonstrated the same findings was an artifact of what they wanted to accomplish.},

A few weeks later, the president invited leaders of the New York Building and Construction Trades Council to the White House and donned a hard hat for photographers to dramatize his gratitude that someone had put people he had recently dubbed "these bums ...blowing up the campuses" in their place. Almost immediately, buttons emblazoned with a hard hat showed up at demonstrations organized to support Nixon's war policy, and the headgear became synonymous with white backlash politics.” ([Kazin, 1998, p. 253](zotero://select/library/items/FC6PVJAX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ES7KA94?page=266))},

  abstract = {The dominant historiographic view and the popular stereotype hold that American labor unequivocally supported the war in Vietnam from the Tonkin Gulf Resolution in 1964 to the Paris Peace Agreement of 1973. This image was created mainly as a result of AFL-CIO leader George Meany's support of both the Johnson and Nixon administrations on the war, and the attacks on antiwar protesters in New York in 1970 by unionized construction workers, the so-called hardhats. Another school of thought contends that after some initial hesitation, workers carried on a vigorous antiwar campaign joining hands with student and New Left protesters. Both these views are far too simplistic. Utilizing the public record, the Reuther Archives, and oral histories and interviews, I examined three aspects of organized labor: the AFL-CIO and George Meany, the UAW and Walter Reuther, and Local 600, the Ford Rouge Plant in Dearborn Michigan. I argue that labor's response was much more complicated and nuanced than most experts have contended; working people held multiple, diverse and often divergent views on the war that changed over time. My examination of portions of the world of labor from top union leadership through factory workers in different trades and portions reveals a multiplicity of responses that reflected a host of factors within and outside the world of work. The labor movement simply mirrored American society. Workers, however, did not generally participate in mass antiwar protests. Many working people hated the war and were aware that they were paying its price in dollars and blood. But they also hated the antiwar movement they had come to know primarily through the media. As the movement became more mainstream, especially after 1970, more workers did raise their voices in protest. Thus, both the stereotype of unequivocal labor support for the war and the concept of the average worker as antiwar crusader should be put to rest.},

Lause describes how the working class radicalized during the war as a response to economic crisis, the political opportunity created by the election of Abraham Lincoln, and the ideology of free labor and abolition. His account moves from battlefield and picket line to the negotiating table, as he discusses how leaders and the rank-and-file alike adapted tactics and modes of operation to specific circumstances. His close attention to women and African Americans, meanwhile, dismantles notions of the working class as synonymous with whiteness and maleness. In addition, Lause offers a nuanced consideration of race's role in the politics of national labor organizations, in segregated industries in the border North and South, and in black resistance in the secessionist South, creatively reading self-emancipation as the largest general strike in U.S. history.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on pre-hire agreements and doublebreasting in the construction industry of the United States. The construction industry plays a major economic role in the United States. In 1986, construction activity contributed \$340.6 billion to the gross national product, employing nearly five million persons. The pre-hire agreements enabled the employers to predict and estimate labor costs and requirements and to ensure a steady supply of skilled workers. Also, since the employer relied on the union for its employees, the union would in fact represent a majority of employees. The concept of doublebreasting refers to a creation of two distinct companies, one of which is a party to a collective bargaining agreement and one that is not. In doing this, a company is able to participate in a wider variety of projects and remain competitive in the industry. There are a few ways in which the unions have challenged doublebreasting. The most common way is when a union representing the employees of the unionized part of the double-breasted company seeks to force the nonunion "open" shop employer to recognize the collective bargaining agreement.},

But unlike industrial unions, the building trades were not victims of cheap imports from an inexorably globalizing economy: high-wage union pipefitters building petrochemical and power plants in Texas did not lose their jobs to low-paid construction workers in or from China.  Instead, their jobs were taken by compatriots, some of them until recently union brothers, employed by cut-rate antiunion construction firms — some of which had been union firms in good standing. Indeed, some nonunion contractors were subsidiaries of long-time respectable union contractors.},

There is the idea of operating completely outside the framework of any labor law, state or federal, as the Farmworkers did initially. A second proposal would require employers to bargain with unions that represent less than a majority of workers in an appropriate bargaining unit. Another suggestion is to make the Thirteenth Amendment rather than the Commerce Clause the jurisdictional basis of an amended Labor Management Relations Act. Perhaps workers' centers utilizing state minimum wage laws could put movement back in the Movement, others say. And of course, the mainstream trade union movement advocates card‐check designation of an exclusive bargaining representative as their solution of choice. Each of these thoughts comes to us as the change that might turn things around.},

They have depicted the AFL and its affiliates as self-satisfied bureaucracies that only tended to skilled craftsmen's needs and either excluded or half-heartedly participated in politics. This dissertation agrees with the works of Michael Kazin, Gary M. Fink, and Richard Schneirov who deal with local labor union history and politics, where union members, factionalized by both major political parties and an array of third-parties, played an important role in determining the preservation of United States democracy. It will show that under a unified national labor law, local and state labor union political activities gained a voice and a measure of justice in the workplace through political solidarity. The value of the political history of the machinists is synonymous with their role in our modern world. Their skills are the industrial cornerstone and keystone of society. Not only do machinists manufacture the machinery for production and all consumer products, but more importantly, they keep them in working order. Cleveland District 54 political history mirrors the entire regional labor history. Although, New York and Chicago surpassed Cleveland's labor leadership position, its pivotal events impacted national labor policy. These include the political achievements of John Fehrenbatch, James Reynolds, and Harry Vollmer, and Cleveland's participation in the Brown Hoisting strike and injunction action, the 1900–1901 eight-hour National Association of Manufacturers' first national agreement, the National Civic Federation membership controversy, and the machinists' periodic advocation of industrial organization and amalgation of lesser-skilled workers. District 54 under Matthew DeMore's long leadership held the distinction of being the largest machinists district before the organization of the huge-aviation districts. DeMore revised its constitution and by-laws and made Cleveland a model for other districts to emulate. The district united the Cleveland labor community by establishing regional affordable family union eye care and the first pre-paid medical care plan in Cleveland. In return, the city honored the machinists as one of Cleveland's most honest and progressive labor unions.},

  abstract = {This article examines the struggle to build the United Automobile Workers in the years after the sit-down strike of 1936–37 in Flint, Michigan. The strike, which historian Sidney Fine has called ‘the most significant American labor conflict in the twentieth century,’ has secured the lion’s share of scholarly attention. While it was very important, much remained to be done to make the UAW an institution that represented almost all American autoworkers. At the time of the strike, only 10 percent of GM’s 47,000 Flint workers belonged to the UAW, while much of the industry was unorganized. This article changes the focus, examining the struggle to build the union after the strike. In this period, the union faced bitter internal divisions, ongoing corporate opposition, patchy membership levels, and economic instability. It struggled to establish itself, and internal records – especially overlooked executive board minutes that are mined here – reveal considerable vulnerability and instability. While the UAW made progress between 1937 and 1941, it was in World War II that it solidified itself nationally, helped by favorable bargaining conditions. Even then, it faced ongoing leadership divisions and rank and file disaffection. Building the union took time and deserves closer interrogation.},

The results suggest that union wage gains are greatest where discretionary pricing power enhances employers' ability to pay and where unions achieve high coverage, practice centralized bargaining, and avoid union fragmentation. On the other hand, centralized bargaining provides no advantage in competitive industries.},

  abstract = {Since 1945 regions undergoing dependent development have displayed a great diversity of regime outcomes. In contrast, the nations of the capitalist core have experienced relatively stable democratic regimes. In this paper I begin the development of a theoretical framework for comprehending these diverse patterns. I argue that regime outcomes vary across regions of the capitalist world economy because structural economic constraints also vary by region. Dependent economies are characterized by two major constraints: 1) the lack of a locally dynamic accumulation process and 2) the persistence of widespread and deep income inequalities. These two factors increase the level of class conflict even while they reduce the level of state resources. Thus, regime officials have insufficient resources to address accumulation and consumption demands simultaneously. Variation in regime outcome in the capitalist periphery is produced by variation in "situations of dependency" (i.e., the forms of integration into the capitalist world economy) that produce different class structures and levels of economic constraints. In the capitalist core, however, locally dynamic accumulation processes and relatively low income inequality provide the structural conditions for stable democratic regimes.},

  abstract = {This dissertation examines the determinants and the economic consequences of alternative types of labor union organization. The early conflicts between craft and industrial union organizations provide strong evidence that the type of union representation is important to workers. I develop a model of the optimal integration of workers under alternative environmental conditions, including most importantly the costs of organizing and policing agreements internally and externally to the collectives. Both multiple and sequential logit estimation techniques are used to test trichotomous decision making procedure based upon the representative individual's utility maximization behavior. The main data set used in this study are the National Longitudinal Survey of older males and the Census of Manufacturers. The National Longitudinal Survey identifies union status and also partitions the organizational structure of the union into skill levels (craft and industrial) and geographical types (local or national). It is therefore possible to identify empirically the factors that make each organizational type more or less likely, as well as to identify the payoff to each type of organization. The empirical results indicate that the rent-sharing concerns of the highly skilled workers induce them to prefer no union at all, ceteris paribus, although, if unionized, they are more likely to organize craft unions than industrial unions. Low skilled workers are also more likely to organize craft unions than industrial unions compared to semi-skilled workers. The result indicates that the traditional focus on union/nonunion status ignores an important dimension of work place bargaining structure. I then analyze the effects of unions on the relative wage gaps. The analysis of wage gaps among workers in the two distinct types of union shows that union wage differentials depend not only on the human characteristics and the nature of the work place but also on the type of bargaining structure. The type of union representation is most important for the high-skilled and workers in less concentrated industry.},

  abstract = {This article draws on ethnographic data to illuminate the problematic position of organized labor in terms of race and gender in the building trades. It argues that construction unions today are caught between the larger legal and moral mandates for equal opportunity and the reproduction of white and male privilege that benefit the majority of the union members. Unions are seen as needing to be highly responsive to matters of discrimination and harassment and thus less able to support and protect the traditional white male worker. On the other hand, union representatives are likely to be drawn from the workplace and thus previously socialized into the industry's distinct workplace cultures. These cultures, as demonstrated, simultaneously promote and make invisible patterns of racism and sexism. When these patterns are made invisible, union representatives are unlikely to intervene in much that occurs. As a result, unions satisfy neither constituency. Implications of this for the construction workplace and the larger labor movement are discussed.},

This is a pity, since nowadays competition has become a sort of political myth, apparently supported by the results of mainstream economics. In this paper, I develop an organic conception of competition from Marx’s work, which contributes to demystify this myth. Marx describes competition as an ‘external coercive law’, which imposes capital logic over the individual and the overall society, regulates the reproduction of class relations and produces a number of economic tendencies. He shows that, historically, it develops with the development of capital and argues that even the appearance of a competitive ‘human nature’ is part of this process.},

Examining examples of local-level activism that include organizing for climate-resilient and equitable communities, the dynamic leadership of Indigenous peoples (especially women) for water and land protection, and diaspora networking, Local Activism for Global Climate Justice also provides theoretical perspectives on how individual action relates to broader social and political processes. Showcasing a diverse range of inspirational and thought-provoking case studies, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars of climate justice, climate change policy, climate ethics and global environmental governance, as well as teachers and climate activists"-- Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {This essay analyzes the rise and decline of organized labor in the oil refining industry along the U.S. Gulf Coast and explains how union organizing in the American South was not quite the abject failure southern labor historians that have portrayed it to be. As was the case across this racially segregated region, labor organizing in refining, beginning in the Great Depression, consisted of a dual struggle, by all workers for dignity, job security, and workplace control, and by racial minorities for workplace equality.~During 1945–1955, the Oil Workers International Union (OWIU) and its successor, the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers (OCAW) union, built on it organizing success to obtain concessions on wages and job security in most of the major Gulf Coast plants. Although Gulf Coast refineries remained segregated and simmered with racial tensions, they also had lower racial barriers to employment than in other southern industries, thanks in part to the union movement. OCAW, however, was not able to cling to industrial power long. In the 1950s, management discovered another way to divide and conquer workers, not so much through the manipulation of racial divisions, but through the contracting out of jobs and other manpower reductions made possible by advances in technology. These developments undermined organized labor’s main source of workplace control: the strike. OCAW remained a large union with national clout through the 1970s, but the focus of bargaining narrowed to compensation and occupational health and safety issues. The transformation of refinery work thus foreshadowed labor market trends not only in the South but also across the United States.},

  abstract = {During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Americans with all sorts of disabilities came to be labeled as "unproductive citizens."  Before that, disabled people had contributed as they were able in homes, on farms, and in the wage labor market, reflecting the fact that Americans had long viewed productivity as a spectrum that varied by age, gender, and ability. But as Sarah F. Rose explains in No Right to Be Idle, a perfect storm of public policies, shifting family structures, and economic changes effectively barred workers with disabilities from mainstream workplaces and simultaneously cast disabled people as morally questionable dependents in need of permanent rehabilitation to achieve "self-care" and "self-support." By tracing the experiences of policymakers, employers, reformers, and disabled people caught up in this epochal transition, Rose masterfully integrates disability history and labor history. She shows how people with disabilities lost access to paid work and the status of "worker--a shift that relegated them and their families to poverty and second-class economic and social citizenship. This has vast consequences for debates about disability, work, poverty, and welfare in the century to come.},

The major form of working-class organization has been trade union organization. Unions were institutionalized during the immediate post-war period with the establishment of a post-war labor capital accord, a major function of which was the institutionalization and narrowing of class conflict along narrow economic dimensions. This paper shows that it is the institutionalized presence of the labor movement that empowers worker militancy and allows workers to strike successfully for higher compensation. Using multivariate time-series regression analysis this paper shows that in times (post-World War II) and industrial sectors in which unions are well established, strikes lead to an increased rate of compensation growth. In the post-war period, in the industrial sectors in which unions are not well institutionalized, strikes are an ineffective weapon in economic class struggles and unionization appears to be economically beneficial.]},

  abstract = {This paper seeks to provide a close examination of the nature and history of the institutional economics that developed at the University of Wisconsin. There has been a significant amount of work done on the thinking of John R. Commons, but much less on the history of Wisconsin institutionalism more generally. The paper proceeds through an examination of the development of the Department of Economics at Wisconsin from the time of the hiring of Richard T. Ely in 1892; the faculty hired to the Department from the early 1900s through to Commons's retirement in 1933; the program of instruction offered, particularly in the late 1920s when the full complement of institutionalist faculty were present; and the areas of study and later careers of Commons's graduate students. It is argued that although Ely played a role in the development of Wisconsin institutionalism, it was Commons who became the center of graduate student work, and that the Department only took on its decidedly institutionalist character after the hiring of Commons and a number of his students as faculty. The program of study in the late 1920s was very heavily institutionalist in character with Commons providing a core course on value and valuation, and a notable emphasis in the fields of public utilities, labor economics, and statistics. Very little instruction was provided in neoclassical theory. Many of Commons's students went on to notable careers in the academic world or public service or both. Wisconsin students were heavily involved in labor legislation issues, and in the development and administration of social security. But a number of Commons's students went into academic careers, and many produced large numbers of PhD students themselves. The decline of Wisconsin-style institutionalism after World War II was not, as has been suggested, a result of Commons's students moving largely into non-academic careers, but of many other factors, including the rise of Keynesian economics, and the migration of what had been much of Wisconsin institutionalism into new schools of industrial relations.},

  abstract = {The organization of work in the construction industry often has been presented as the exemplar of “craft administration” wherein managerial positions are of relatively low significance. Occupational control of employment and work structure in this context presumably is manifest through the craft union. On the other hand, research on other industries has shown the managerial position in the firm to be a source of extrinsic and intrinsic reward. This results from the manager's pivotal position in the bureaucratized labor process. This paper seeks to reconcile these perspectives. Data from a survey of 246 unionized construction workers and 14 local union officers from nine building trades are used to assess the impact of the managerial position and union involvement on work autonomy (self-direction and freedom from supervision) and employment security (unemployment and trade agreement infringements). In general, the results indicate that managerial affiliations to employers' firms are associated with greater autonomy and more employment security. Union involvement has contradictory consequences for individual tradespeople.},

Despite research demonstrating the potential for judicial action to alleviate drift, we know little about the potential for the Supreme Court to facilitate policy drift. I argue that the Supreme Court may operate as a powerful agent of drift by stripping statutes of ambiguity, foreclosing policy innovation in institutions outside of Congress, and curtailing bureaucratic discretion and authority. To demonstrate these mechanisms, I show how in the case of federal labor law, the Court’s jurisprudence addressing the right to strike, federal preemption, and National Labor Relations Board authority played a central role in gradually undoing the efficacy of The National Labor Relations Act. This inquiry has important implications for understanding public policy, judicial power, the development of American labor law, and American democracy.},

Data from a wide range of work settings suggest it is premature to conclude that management has succeeded in appropriating workers' knowledge, accountability, and responsibility for work. Subcontracting, “lumping,” use of prefabricated materials, and other factors have undermined the centralization of managerial controls. Moreover, a craft ideology shared by workers, supervisors, and contractors pervades all types of work organizations. Finally, the labor market has become so fluid and dynamic that it no longer conforms to the traditional construct of an internal labor market. Since these observations likely apply to other work settings, a refinement of labor process theory is in order.},

  abstract = {Pattern bargaining stands out as both an under-researched and controversial subject. This article is an analytical and empirical contribution to this debate. Theoretically, it provides a conceptual framework, which enables analysis to systematically differentiate between distinct forms of pattern bargaining in terms of scope, agency, development and function, which arise from differing contexts in terms of interest configuration, power relations and economic conditions. This framework is used to develop testable hypotheses on pattern bargaining as a mechanism of inter-industry bargaining co-ordination. The empirical part of the article examines these hypotheses for collective bargaining from 1969 to 2004 in Austria, which is commonly seen as a paradigm case of pattern bargaining. The article concludes by highlighting the broader implications its findings have from a cross-nationally comparative perspective.},

  abstract = {Twenty-five years ago, a vocal faction of progressive union leaders, labor educators, and academics charted a new path forward for American labor unions. Proponents of “social movement unionism” sought to reverse unions’ flagging strength through redoubled organizing drives, street mobilizations, “public dramas,” and labor-community coalitions. While case studies describing this repertoire of contention abound, there are few systematic analyses that take stock of emergent union strategy. Based on an analysis of 76 case studies of union-led collective-bargaining campaigns, strikes, and political mobilizations, I argue that contemporary labor union revitalization is best understood not as a singular, movement-inspired struggle but as a mix of four strategies— sometimes competing, sometimes complementary—each espousing divergent visions for how to recapture social, economic, and political power. These divergent visions, in turn, shape how unions form alliances and construct class-based identities.},

Watch how NFL rule changes made linemen gigantic: http://bit.ly/2BSOf5n Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO In the past 20 years, over \$7 billion in public money has gone towards financing the construction and renovation of NFL football stadiums. Owners argue that public investment in private football franchises will bring a boom of economic activity to  local economies. But this argument doesn’t hold up. In reality, stadiums and their upkeep wind up costing cities millions of dollars.  For owners, new stadiums mean more profits. They get to host the Super Bowl, sell naming rights to other corporations, and build increasingly opulent and expensive premium seating. For cities, nabbing an itinerant football franchise looking for a new home field can be a big political win. And residents want teams and the hometown pride that comes with it. Football teams give cities a sense of identity and they are paying more than ever for them. New stadiums aren’t the economic powerhouses owners promise they’ll be. But as long there are more cities that want a home team than there are franchises, it looks like taxpayers are going to keep footing the bill.

Data from archaeological work conducted by Sonoma State University during the Cypress Freeway Replacement Project is used in an historical materialist exploration of class-consciousness among railroad workers in a late-19th-century working-class neighborhood in West Oakland, California. Comparing aspects of diet and dining, this study focuses on divisions among the railroad workers along the lines of craft-skill and nativity, examining the ways skilled craft unionists used the assumptions of Victorian ideology to organize against both their employers and other groups of workers, especially immigrants.},

His two terms as president of the United Steelworkers of America, from 1983 until 1994, capped off a career in labour relations spanning nearly five decades. Among his many notable achievements were the new bargaining techniques he developed to face challenges from anti-union politicians such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Williams also played a major role in the structural readjustment of the North American steel industry during its most turbulent period, the 1980s and 1990s. In his memoirs, Williams vividly recounts his life in labour, with all its triumphs, challenges, hopes, and dreams. While telling his own story, Williams also traces the rise and transformation of the labour movement from the Second World War to today. Providing an insider's perspective on union developments and issues, One Day Longer is a profound reflection of Williams's impressive career."--Pub. desc},

This article argues that the reverse-J curve is itself the result of two distinct kinds of effects of workers' power on capitalists' interests: one, a negative effect, in which workers' power undermines the capacity of capitalists to unilaterally make various kinds of decisions, and the second, a positive effect, in which workers' power helps capitalists solve the various kinds of collective action problems they face.},
