	abstract = {[A major characteristic of class relations in the United States has been the absence of a self consciously defined and politically cohesive working class. The major form of working-class organization has been trade union organization. Unions were institutionalized during the immediate post-war period with the establishment of a post-war labor capital accord, a major function of which was the institutionalization and narrowing of class conflict along narrow economic dimensions. This paper shows that it is the institutionalized presence of the labor movement that empowers worker militancy and allows workers to strike successfully for higher compensation. Using multivariate time-series regression analysis this paper shows that in times (post-World War {II}) and industrial sectors in which unions are well established, strikes lead to an increased rate of compensation growth. In the post-war period, in the industrial sectors in which unions are not well institutionalized, strikes are an ineffective weapon in economic class struggles and unionization appears to be economically beneficial.]},

This is a pity, since nowadays competition has become a sort of political myth, apparently supported by the results of mainstream economics. In this paper, I develop an organic conception of competition from Marx’s work, which contributes to demystify this myth. Marx describes competition as an ‘external coercive law’, which imposes capital logic over the individual and the overall society, regulates the reproduction of class relations and produces a number of economic tendencies. He shows that, historically, it develops with the development of capital and argues that even the appearance of a competitive ‘human nature’ is part of this process.},

Theoretically, it provides a conceptual framework, which enables analysis to systematically differentiate between distinct forms of pattern bargaining in terms of scope, agency, development and function, which arise from differing contexts in terms of interest configuration, power relations and economic conditions. This framework is used to develop testable hypotheses on pattern bargaining as a mechanism of inter-industry bargaining co-ordination. The empirical part of the article examines these hypotheses for collective bargaining from 1969 to 2004 in Austria, which is commonly seen as a paradigm case of pattern bargaining. The article concludes by highlighting the broader implications its findings have from a cross-nationally comparative perspective.},

The results suggest that union wage gains are greatest where discretionary pricing power enhances employers' ability to pay and where unions achieve high coverage, practice centralized bargaining, and avoid union fragmentation. On the other hand, centralized bargaining provides no advantage in competitive industries.},

It argues that construction unions today are caught between the larger legal and moral mandates for equal opportunity and the reproduction of white and male privilege that benefit the majority of the union members. Unions are seen as needing to be highly responsive to matters of discrimination and harassment and thus less able to support and protect the traditional white male worker. On the other hand, union representatives are likely to be drawn from the workplace and thus previously socialized into the industry's distinct workplace cultures. These cultures, as demonstrated, simultaneously promote and make invisible patterns of racism and sexism. When these patterns are made invisible, union representatives are unlikely to intervene in much that occurs. As a result, unions satisfy neither constituency. Implications of this for the construction workplace and the larger labor movement are discussed.},

Almost immediately, buttons emblazoned with a hard hat showed up at demonstrations organized to support Nixon's war policy, and the headgear became synonymous with white backlash politics.” ([Kazin, 1998, p. 253](zotero://select/library/items/{FC}6PVJAX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7ES7KA94?page=266))},

	abstract = {This article proposes a general theoretical framework for understanding the concept of "class compromise" in terms of a "reverse-J" model of the relationship between the associational power of workers and the interests of capitalists: increases in working-class power adversely affect capitalist-class interests until such power crosses some intermediate threshold beyond which further increases in working-class power are potentially beneficial to capitalists' interests. This article argues that the reverse-J curve is itself the result of two distinct kinds of effects of workers' power on capitalists' interests: one, a negative effect, in which workers' power undermines the capacity of capitalists to unilaterally make various kinds of decisions, and the second, a positive effect, in which workers' power helps capitalists solve the various kinds of collective action problems they face.},

	abstract = {Since 1945 regions undergoing dependent development have displayed a great diversity of regime outcomes. In contrast, the nations of the capitalist core have experienced relatively stable democratic regimes. In this paper I begin the development of a theoretical framework for comprehending these diverse patterns. I argue that regime outcomes vary across regions of the capitalist world economy because structural economic constraints also vary by region. Dependent economies are characterized by two major constraints: 1) the lack of a locally dynamic accumulation process and 2) the persistence of widespread and deep income inequalities. These two factors increase the level of class conflict even while they reduce the level of state resources. Thus, regime officials have insufficient resources to address accumulation and consumption demands simultaneously. Variation in regime outcome in the capitalist periphery is produced by variation in "situations of dependency" (i.e., the forms of integration into the capitalist world economy) that produce different class structures and levels of economic constraints. In the capitalist core, however, locally dynamic accumulation processes and relatively low income inequality provide the structural conditions for stable democratic regimes.},

This article describes the decline in union density, the drop in construction wages, the growth of anti-union forces, the changes in labor force demographics, the shift toward construction management, and the emergence of an underground economy.

	abstract = {This article focuses on pre-hire agreements and doublebreasting in the construction industry of the United States. The construction industry plays a major economic role in the United States. In 1986, construction activity contributed \$340.6 billion to the gross national product, employing nearly five million persons. The pre-hire agreements enabled the employers to predict and estimate labor costs and requirements and to ensure a steady supply of skilled workers. Also, since the employer relied on the union for its employees, the union would in fact represent a majority of employees. The concept of doublebreasting refers to a creation of two distinct companies, one of which is a party to a collective bargaining agreement and one that is not. In doing this, a company is able to participate in a wider variety of projects and remain competitive in the industry. There are a few ways in which the unions have challenged doublebreasting. The most common way is when a union representing the employees of the unionized part of the double-breasted company seeks to force the nonunion "open" shop employer to recognize the collective bargaining agreement.},

Today, union members still earn wages and benefits that compare favorably to those of college graduates. But as union strength has declined over the last fifty years, a growing non-union sector offers lower compensation and more hazardous conditions, undermining the earlier tradition of upward mobility. Revitalization of the industry depends on unions shedding past racial and gender discriminatory practices, embracing organizing, diversity, and the new immigrant workforce, and preparing for technological changes. Mark Erlich blends long-view history with his personal experience inside the building trades to explain one of our economy's least understood sectors. Erlich's multifaceted account includes the dynamics of the industry, the backdrop of union policies, and powerful stories of everyday life inside the trades. He offers a much-needed overview of construction's past and present while exploring roads to the future"-- Provided by publisher.},

Despite a valiant effort by millions of rank-and-file workers to prevent its passage, Taft-Hartley became law on June 23, 1947 when the Senate overrode President Truman’s veto. Taft-Hartley halted what had been a remarkable decade of progress for working people, tamed union militancy, and set the stage for the long decline of the U.S. labor movement. We are still feeling its effects today.},

The A’s are planning to move from their current home at the Oakland Coliseum to a new, privately financed ballpark located at the Howard Terminal site near Jack London Square.  If the A’s and the Oakland City Council can’t find an agreement on the new proposed ballpark at Howard Terminal, thousands of jobs and the billions of dollars of economic activity will leave our community.  Alameda Labor supports the A’s proposed Howard Terminal ballpark! The project proposed will protect existing Union jobs and bring thousands of {NEW} Union jobs for Oakland workers, both during construction and for the long-term. It will also provide a significant boost to Oakland’s economy and create substantial economic activity in the Howard Terminal area.  Benefits of the A’s project include:  {JOBS}: The new ballpark will protect more than 2,000 Union jobs that will disappear if the team leaves Oakland and will create more than 4,000 new jobs at the new ballpark and surrounding development. Construction will also create an estimated 2,700 new Union jobs.
    {ECONOMIC} {ACTIVITY}: Construction on the ballpark will provide a significant boost to our economy at a time when it’s more needed than ever. Construction is estimated to generate \$8.7 billion in economic activity, and the ballpark is estimated to generate an additional \$2.5 billion annually once opened.
    {HOUSING}: The proposed project includes 3,000 new units of housing, which will include affordable housing units.
    {PARKS}: The project also includes 18+ acres of new, publicly accessible parks on the Oakland waterfront.
    {ENVIRONMENTAL} {PROTECTIONS}: The Howard Terminal project will protect Oakland from sea level rise and will be built to an environmental gold standard. Cleanup of toxic contaminants in soil and groundwater is also included in the A’s proposal.
    {COMMUNITY} {BENEFITS}: this agreement will include hundreds of millions of dollars in critically needed benefits for the Oakland community.  For Oakland's working families, we are urging the Oakland City Council to come to an agreement with the A's that keeps those Union jobs {HERE} - in {OUR} community. You can help protect your fellow Oakland workers and help us save thousands of vital jobs for Oakland residents.  We need your help! Please use this form to ask the Oakland City Council to find an agreement with the A’s that keeps our {JOBS} here. Please share this with your friends, family and colleagues.},

Watch how {NFL} rule changes made linemen gigantic: http://bit.ly/2BSOf5n

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In the past 20 years, over \$7 billion in public money has gone towards financing the construction and renovation of {NFL} football stadiums. Owners argue that public investment in private football franchises will bring a boom of economic activity to  local economies. But this argument doesn’t hold up. In reality, stadiums and their upkeep wind up costing cities millions of dollars. 

For owners, new stadiums mean more profits. They get to host the Super Bowl, sell naming rights to other corporations, and build increasingly opulent and expensive premium seating.

For cities, nabbing an itinerant football franchise looking for a new home field can be a big political win. And residents want teams and the hometown pride that comes with it. Football teams give cities a sense of identity and they are paying more than ever for them.

New stadiums aren’t the economic powerhouses owners promise they’ll be. But as long there are more cities that want a home team than there are franchises, it looks like taxpayers are going to keep footing the bill.

	shorttitle = {Local activism for global climate justice},
	abstract = {"This book will inspire and spark grassroots action to address the inequitable impacts of climate change, by showing how this can be tackled and the many benefits of doing so. With contributions from climate activists and engaged young authors, this volume explores the many ways in which people are proactively working to advance climate justice. The book pays special attention to Canada and the Great Lakes watershed, showing how the effects of climate change span local, regional, and global scales through the impact of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts, with related economic and social effects that cross political jurisdictions. Examining examples of local-level activism that include organizing for climate-resilient and equitable communities, the dynamic leadership of Indigenous peoples (especially women) for water and land protection, and diaspora networking, Local Activism for Global Climate Justice also provides theoretical perspectives on how individual action relates to broader social and political processes. Showcasing a diverse range of inspirational and thought-provoking case studies, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars of climate justice, climate change policy, climate ethics and global environmental governance, as well as teachers and climate activists"-- Provided by publisher},

The percentage of construction workers employed by union contractors has declined even further because the fraction of union members working in the open shop sector rose from 29 to 46 percent between 1973 and 1981. The growth of the union-nonunion wage gap between 1967 and 1973 contributed to the initial decline in the percentage unionized, but that gap did not widen after 1973 and actually has narrowed substantially since 1978. Probably more influential has been the erosion of the productivity advantage of union contractors, which dropped substantially between 1972 and 1977 and vanished by 1982.},

Veteran journalist Stephen Franklin shows how labor disputes at Bridgestone/Firestone, Caterpillar, and A.E. Staley left lasting scars on this town and its citizens--and marked a turning point in American labor history. When workers went on strike to retain such basic rights as job security and the 8-hour day, the corporations hit back with unprecedented hard-line tactics. Through the moving stories of individual workers and union activists, Franklin illuminates the hardships and disillusionment left in the wake of the strikes, and the powerful forces that caught an unprepared labor leadership off guard. He vividly portrays how the balance of labor-management power was shifted by corporate globalization, cutthroat labor practices, the outdated responses of national unions and government regulators, and an apathetic public. Reflecting on the hard-won lessons of Decatur, the book describes how the quality of work and life are now threatened--not just for blue-collar workers, but for all Americans--and what it will take to safeguard them.},

	abstract = {Twenty-five years ago, a vocal faction of progressive union leaders, labor educators, and academics charted a new path forward for American labor unions. Proponents of “social movement unionism” sought to reverse unions’ flagging strength through redoubled organizing drives, street mobilizations, “public dramas,” and labor-community coalitions. While case studies describing this repertoire of contention abound, there are few systematic analyses that take stock of emergent union strategy. Based on an analysis of 76 case studies of union-led collective-bargaining campaigns, strikes, and political mobilizations, I argue that contemporary labor union revitalization is best understood not as a singular, movement-inspired struggle but as a mix of four strategies— sometimes competing, sometimes complementary—each espousing divergent visions for how to recapture social, economic, and political power. These divergent visions, in turn, shape how unions form alliances and construct class-based identities.},

Born in Evadale, Texas, Young began working at the East Texas Pulp \& Paper Company.  He joined the International Brotherhood of Pulp, Sulphite and Paper Mill Workers, and soon became a shop steward, then in 1971, he was elected as president of his local union.  That same year, the union merged into the new United Paperworkers' International Union, with Young continuing in his post.In 1973, Young was asked by the international union to assist with workers' campaigns in Houston and across east Texas.  He was successful in the role, and from 1975 worked full-time for the union as an international representative.  In 1988, he became the union's vice president for Region {VI}.In 1996, Young defeated Gerald Johnston, to win election as president of the union.  From 1997, he also served as a vice-president of the {AFL}-{CIO}.  As leader of the union, he negotiated a merger which formed the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union; he became the founding president of the new union, in 1999.  He continued to focus on strengthening the union's negotiating position, which he concluded would be best served by a merger into the United Steelworkers of America, which was completed in 2005.  He then retired, dying in 2019.},

His two terms as president of the United Steelworkers of America, from 1983 until 1994, capped off a career in labour relations spanning nearly five decades. Among his many notable achievements were the new bargaining techniques he developed to face challenges from anti-union politicians such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Williams also played a major role in the structural readjustment of the North American steel industry during its most turbulent period, the 1980s and 1990s. In his memoirs, Williams vividly recounts his life in labour, with all its triumphs, challenges, hopes, and dreams. While telling his own story, Williams also traces the rise and transformation of the labour movement from the Second World War to today. Providing an insider's perspective on union developments and issues, One Day Longer is a profound reflection of Williams's impressive career."--Pub. desc},

	abstract = {This essay analyzes the rise and decline of organized labor in the oil refining industry along the U.S. Gulf Coast and explains how union organizing in the American South was not quite the abject failure southern labor historians that have portrayed it to be. As was the case across this racially segregated region, labor organizing in refining, beginning in the Great Depression, consisted of a dual struggle, by all workers for dignity, job security, and workplace control, and by racial minorities for workplace equality. During 1945–1955, the Oil Workers International Union ({OWIU}) and its successor, the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers ({OCAW}) union, built on it organizing success to obtain concessions on wages and job security in most of the major Gulf Coast plants. Although Gulf Coast refineries remained segregated and simmered with racial tensions, they also had lower racial barriers to employment than in other southern industries, thanks in part to the union movement. {OCAW}, however, was not able to cling to industrial power long. In the 1950s, management discovered another way to divide and conquer workers, not so much through the manipulation of racial divisions, but through the contracting out of jobs and other manpower reductions made possible by advances in technology. These developments undermined organized labor’s main source of workplace control: the strike. {OCAW} remained a large union with national clout through the 1970s, but the focus of bargaining narrowed to compensation and occupational health and safety issues. The transformation of refinery work thus foreshadowed labor market trends not only in the South but also across the United States.},

This largely non-white, working-class city of a hundred thousand had experienced the by-products of decades' worth of poverty, substandard housing, and poorly funded public education. It had one of the highest homicide rates, per capita, in the country and a jobless rate often twice the national average. But in 2012, when veteran labour reporter Steve Early moved from New England to Richmond, he witnessed a surprising transformation. In Refinery Town, Early chronicles the ten years of successful community organizing in Richmond that raised the minimum wage, defeated a casino development project, created a municipal {ID} to aid undocumented workers, reduced crime through "community policing," challenged home foreclosures, and took on a big oil giant. This compelling story of a city remade provides a model for citizens engaged in local politics and community building anywhere.},

	abstract = {This article examines the struggle to build the United Automobile Workers in the years after the sit-down strike of 1936–37 in Flint, Michigan. The strike, which historian Sidney Fine has called ‘the most significant American labor conflict in the twentieth century,’ has secured the lion’s share of scholarly attention. While it was very important, much remained to be done to make the {UAW} an institution that represented almost all American autoworkers. At the time of the strike, only 10 percent of {GM}’s 47,000 Flint workers belonged to the {UAW}, while much of the industry was unorganized. This article changes the focus, examining the struggle to build the union after the strike. In this period, the union faced bitter internal divisions, ongoing corporate opposition, patchy membership levels, and economic instability. It struggled to establish itself, and internal records – especially overlooked executive board minutes that are mined here – reveal considerable vulnerability and instability. While the {UAW} made progress between 1937 and 1941, it was in World War {II} that it solidified itself nationally, helped by favorable bargaining conditions. Even then, it faced ongoing leadership divisions and rank and file disaffection. Building the union took time and deserves closer interrogation.},

	abstract = {When do labor movements come to support universal welfare policies? This article examines this question through a comparative account of the British and American labor movements at the turn of the twentieth century. Drawing on newspaper and meeting records from the Amalgamated Society of Engineers ({ASE}), the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants ({ASRS}), the Cigarmakers International Union ({CMIU}), and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen ({BLF}) from the mid-nineteenth century to World War I, it considers why, given a common tradition of exclusive benefits, the two movements diverged on the question of universal state health and pension schemes at the turn of the century—with the British labor movement abandoning its voluntarist orientation and the {AFL} preserving it.Complementing existing sociological accounts that emphasize state and party structure, sectoral composition, pace and quality of industrial change, and the demographic makeup of labor movements, this article builds on approaches from the sociology of organizations in centering the importance of organizational arenas in shaping trade union strategies and aims. In particular, it investigates the role of friendly and fraternal societies in structuring trade union interests over this period. The article demonstrates how changes within the friendly and fraternal society movement shaped the contextual significance and strategic value of benefit provision in each trade union over time. In doing so, it opens the way for a deeper reflection on the importance of organizational reasoning in shaping trade union organizing and the trajectory of welfare institutions.},

There is the idea of operating completely outside the framework of any labor law, state or federal, as the Farmworkers did initially. A second proposal would require employers to bargain with unions that represent less than a majority of workers in an appropriate bargaining unit. Another suggestion is to make the Thirteenth Amendment rather than the Commerce Clause the jurisdictional basis of an amended Labor Management Relations Act. Perhaps workers' centers utilizing state minimum wage laws could put movement back in the Movement, others say. And of course, the mainstream trade union movement advocates card‐check designation of an exclusive bargaining representative as their solution of choice. Each of these thoughts comes to us as the change that might turn things around.},

Many of these organizing efforts are being compromised by a failure to confront the way social struggles are shaped by the social conditions in which they are situated. Organizing campaigns are frequently initiated without regard to whether a given group of people, if organized, would have the power to force changes from the institutions they are confronting. The failure to face this critical power dynamic leads activists to overemphasize the importance of both the consciousness‐raising aspect of the work and the power dynamics between professional staff and the people being organized. The result is that in many cases they are transforming the appearance
              but not the substance
              of what are, in effect, traditional advocacy campaigns.},

	title = {Solar Flux: Remaking landscapes, labor, and environmental politics in California},
	abstract = {From 2015-2020, massive booms in solar power and high-speed rail reconstructed landscapes across California's San Joaquin Valley. Globally rare alliances of construction unions with environmental justice and immigrant movements won breakthroughs in regional politics. How did construction workers reshape their power in response to the booms–and what formed their politics in this extraordinary direction? This dissertation argues that construction worker power hinged on unions' capacity to reproduce the workforce for urgent landscape transformations, while labor alliances were driven by shared political exclusion and common household struggles over social reproduction of the region's working class, Mexican-American majority. Drawing on ﬁve years of ethnographic and archival research, I compare the Fresno-Madera region, where these construction labor-immigrant-environmental justice alliances prevailed at crucial moments, to the Bakersﬁeld region just to the south, where limited household ties, unstable overall employment, and conﬂicts over oil fractured potential coalitions. In conversation with environmental justice, Marxist feminist, and Marxist geography approaches–including Gramscian interpretations of Clyde Woods, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, and Matthew Huber–I develop a theory of environmental leverage, explaining how landscape transformation and the labor involved can challenge or entrench hegemony. The breakthroughs made by San Joaquin alliances in winning municipal ofﬁce, jobsite power, and infrastructure redistribution help show how working and oppressed people can build pressing climate transitions by their own blueprints.},

We explore the trialectic relationship between capital, labour and nature in Canada’s public transit unions, primarily through the lens of labour geography. In a review of union documents and Canadian newspapers we find the state uses the environment as a wedge issue in its ‘war or position’ with unions, representing workers’ strike actions as harmful to the environment and the community. The state’s positioning of {ATU} members as crucial to both the functioning of communities and environmental sustainability lends itself to counter-hegemonic campaign strategies. We examine a recent campaign by Toronto’s {ATU} Local 113 entitled “Protecting What Matters” as a local union’s community and environmental strategies during a period of austerity. The paper concludes with lessons learned from a labour geography perspective and calls for a more community based approach to resistance.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the role of the most-similar systems design and most-different systems design in comparative public policy analysis. The methods are based on John Stuart Mill’s ‘eliminative methods of induction’ and regularly mentioned in educational books in social research methodology in general and in comparative politics in particular. However, their role has been less prominent in the literature on public policy. The methods are particularly useful in cross-country studies where the number of research units is limited, but where the researcher operates with a variable-oriented approach. The present contribution outlines how the most-similar systems design and the most-different systems design should be applied in deductive and inductive research efforts. It also challenges claims that the methods are unable to cope with interaction effects and multiple causation. The chapter also discusses to what extent the two methods are still relevant, given the recent advances made in multi-level modelling and in qualitative comparative analysis ({OCA}). Here, the argument is raised that the most-similar systems design and the most-different systems design are useful for accounting for complex social processes, and also have the advantage of making it possible to eliminate a large number of potentially relevant explanatory variables from further analysis. As a consequence thereof, regression models using multi-level techniques should often be constructed according to the logical foundations of a most-different systems approach in situations where the number of cases is low at the system level.},

	abstract = {Scholars have made important advances in explaining policy drift, uncovering the prevalence of drift in veto-riddled systems, the importance of bureaucratic discretion and statutory ambiguity in combatting drift, and its feedback effects. Despite research demonstrating the potential for judicial action to alleviate drift, we know little about the potential for the Supreme Court to facilitate policy drift. I argue that the Supreme Court may operate as a powerful agent of drift by stripping statutes of ambiguity, foreclosing policy innovation in institutions outside of Congress, and curtailing bureaucratic discretion and authority. To demonstrate these mechanisms, I show how in the case of federal labor law, the Court’s jurisprudence addressing the right to strike, federal preemption, and National Labor Relations Board authority played a central role in gradually undoing the efficacy of The National Labor Relations Act. This inquiry has important implications for understanding public policy, judicial power, the development of American labor law, and American democracy.},
