\section{Argument}
\begin{frame}{Argument}
	US Building Trade unions organize their workers differently. Most labor unions compel employers to negotiate, but the Building Trades engage in voluntary negotiations, relying on workers' skill levels rather than strike leverage. 
	\newline\newline
	\textbf{Building Trades}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Are frequently political outliers.
		\item Oppose progressive environmental policies.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Alignin more closely with the petrochemical industry (e.g., pipelines).
		\end{itemize}
		\item Are not supportive of single-payer healthcare.
	\end{itemize}
	
	%This approach correlates with their frequent political deviations from the broader US labor movement, particularly in opposing progressive environmental policies and aligning more closely with the petrochemical industry on environmental issues, and not supporting single-payer healthcare.

    \item Durability: institutional arrangements.
    \item Structural features \& constraints.
    \item Institutional changes (mergers, etc.).
    \item Evolutionary or generative approach.\footnote{Reed 1997}

\end{tabular}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Interviews}
\begin{frame}{Methods: Interviews}
\begin{itemize}
	\item While the Building Trades largely "organizes the bosses"\footnote{A wonderfully apt description that I owe to Mark Dudzic, former OCAW official and long-time Labor for Single Payer Organizer.} rather than the workers already employed, there is still some variation in how they organize. 
	\item National Labor Relations representation case petition database: 98 building trades unions have filed for a representation election in 2023. 
	\item Emails sent to union's office or organizer (email addresses from the union's website.)
	\item Three union organizers were interviewed.
\end{itemize}

%The results were obtained by removing company names that did not contain the words "construction," "constructors," "electrical," "plumbing," "mechanical," "builder," or "builders." If the certified representative matched the names of any of the Building Trades’ constituent unions, they were also added to the list. While this method did not filter out all non-Building Trades unions, it probably erroneously excluded some from the filtered list because it is nearly impossible to include every possible search term.

    \newline\newline
    However, it was not designed for the Building Trades because they were already organizing differently.

    Construction unions may follow either path, but other unions may not voluntarily negotiate the way that construction unions can.

		\item United Association (UA)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Apprenticeship and training as a ``bargaining chip."
				\item Prehire agreements are the norm.
				\item Became a junior partner to capital because of institutional/structural. features.
	\end{itemize}
		\item OCAW/USW
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Never became a junior partner to capital — relationship antagonistic
		\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{OCAW/USW vs. UA: Different occupational context}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item United Association (UA)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The pre-hire agreement made the movement between employers with the same wages/benefits possible.
			\item Hiring hall formed as an institution
		\end{itemize}
		\item OCAW/USW
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Same plant entire career
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Political context}
\begin{frame}{OCAW/USW vs. UA: Political context}

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Historically had Communist Party members
			\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Line Between Worker and Owner}
\begin{frame}{OCAW/USW vs. UA: The Line Between Worker and Owner}
	\begin{itemize}

			\item Construction firms are small
			\item Union members as worker-owners — infrequent, but it happens.
		\end{itemize}
		\item OCAW/USW
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Members are always wage workers.
				\item Employers are usually large multi-nationals

% Findings: Intra-Building Trades
\section{Intra-Building Trades}

\begin{frame}{Intra-Building Trades: Interviews}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I expected to find building trades (BT) unions that organize this way to be more involved in community and progressive organizations and other labor organizations.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item By and large, this is \emph{not} the case.
		\end{itemize}
		\item They pursue this strategy for pragmatic reasons.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Not indicative of a different political orientation.
		\end{itemize}
		\item BT unions pursue different organizing strategies depending on the conditions.
		\item BT unions often use this approach for service-based employers or where employers have a permanent workforce — usually not construction work.
		\item No “spillover” into the construction side of the union.
	\end{itemize}
